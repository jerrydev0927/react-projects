    question: "What’s the difference between Google One and Google Drive?",

    question:
      "How does the storage I get with Google One compare to what I get for free?",
    answer:
      "Every Google Account starts with 15 GB of free storage that’s shared across Google Drive, Gmail, and Google Photos. When you upgrade to Google One, your total storage increases to 100 GB or more depending on what plan you choose. You also get extra member benefits and access to support from Google experts - all of which you can share with your family. Learn more about storage with Google One.",

    question: "How can I use Google One if I’m not a member?",
    answer:
      "As a free Google One user, you can back up data on your Android phone, and also free up space in your Google Account using the storage manager. If you get a Google One membership, you’ll unlock additional features like expanded cloud storage, support from our team of Google experts, and exclusive benefits.",

    question: "Who can I share my Google One membership with?",

    question:
      "What do I share with my family group? Can they see all my stored stuff?",
    answer:
      "You can share all the benefits of Google One with your family group — without sharing any of your personal files. Family members share the storage space that comes with your Google One plan. But your family group can’t see what you store unless you specifically share it with them from Google Drive, Gmail, or Google Photos. Learn more about sharing Google Drive files.",

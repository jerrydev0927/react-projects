      "I'm just writing to thank you for this product. I had failed in so many interviews before, but I wanted to get into a top tech company so much that I even enrolled in a Master's program. Even then, I was unsure if I had what it takes to make it. From the moment I heard your first video explanation, I thought 'this is exactly the way to solve an interview question' (plus the extra points you can grab by asking clarifying questions). After a few months of studying, mainly on AlgoExpert, I got offers to intern at Microsoft and Google!",

      "AlgoExpert was the backbone of my technical coding interview preparation. It allows you to efficiently work through the most common variations of problems asked by top-tier companies without having to spend hours 'battling' an algorithm only to come up with an inefficient or incorrect solution. There are a lot of resources available for repetition, but AlgoExpert differentiates its product by providing the 'how' and 'why' in clear and concise videos. Developing a deeper understanding of how to approach these problems is better than trying to memorize lines of code. I highly recommend AlgoExpert.",

      "As a scientist who was looking to break into Tech, I knew the underlying logic of programming, but I had a lot of gaps in my understanding, especially on the types of algorithms questions asked at interviews. I can confidently say that AlgoExpert is one of the best resources out there for interview preparation, with fantastic video tutorials and an excellent question selection that allows you to get a deep understanding of the topics and confidence in your problem solving ability. The site is incredibly intuitive to use and I think that the staff are some of the best out there, being incredibly supportive and passionate about offering a great customer experience. I cannot recommend AlgoExpert highly enough.",
